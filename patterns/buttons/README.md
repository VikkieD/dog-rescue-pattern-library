Buttons in this website will use the primary color to help them stand out against the white and navy blue backgrounds. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The buttons with the icons direct you to the main sections of the website
- The light buttons are for dark background areas
- The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image
